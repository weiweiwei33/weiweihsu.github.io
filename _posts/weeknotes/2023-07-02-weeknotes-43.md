Wow, I wrote my last weeknote 3 years ago, that feels like an entire lifetime ago. I truly feel like the 2020 Weiwei is a different person from the 2022 Weiwei, which is a also different person from me in 2023. I guess what I'm trying to say is, so much shit happened in the last three years it's insane!

Ok I will try and come back to elaborate on this some day, but no promise!
