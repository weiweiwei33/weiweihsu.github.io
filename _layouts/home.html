  In general, I strive to be fearless, but not delusional; be joyful, but not
  naive; be thoughtful, but not stubborn; be communicative, but not commanding;
  be credible, but not infamous.

  <br /><br />

  In the long-term, I want to help close the gap between ideals and reality,
  academic and industry.

  <br /><br />
  Currently, I'm gardening at <a href="https://sprout.place">Sprout</a> because
  computing environments can be and should be more fluid, playful, equitable,
  fun, humane, expressive ++. I’m also building small products at
  <a href="http://tinyfactories.space">Tiny Factories</a> because I believe
  there's a future where indiepreneurs thrive.

  <!-- In a few years, I hope to take the learnings from making, launching, marketing, selling products in a monthly-cycle and apply them to bigger projects. -->

  <!-- I think a lot about relationships, interactions, and stories. I'm gradually thinking more about tactility, spaces, conversations, and urban systems.

I write weeknotes to reflect upon my day-to-day actions. I write blog posts to summarize a feeling I have. If you'd like to converse about something, or view my design portfolio, you can email me at <a href="mailto:wei@weiweihsu.com?Subject=Hello" target="_top">wei@weiweihsu.com</a>

Currently, I'm adjusting to my post-college life. I'm trying to understand <i>how</i> I can devote my time to what I want to do.  -->

  My senior thesis was on the "Space" of Computing: Computer went from being a
  job title for people who do calculations, to large machines that would fill up
  an entire room, to devices so small that they would fit into different objects
  and dissolve into our environment. Clearly, our conception of "computing" has
  changed and <i>continues</i> to change. This work identified dimensions that
  constitute the "space of computing". While some dimensions are less
  recognizable than others, defining them is an essential undertaking because
  defining the scope of "computing space" is to understand past, present, and
  future of our technological advancements, what we've already done and what
  we've neglected. You can view the thesis presentation
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVFS85Zx6uw">here</a> and the paper I
  co-authored
  <a href="https://jods.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/6pewbpry/release/1">here</a>.

  Thank you for spending some time here. Stay a while and write me a letter if
  you aren't in a rush! But of course, no pressure ;)
