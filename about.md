I really enjoy mixing together toys, art, architecture, and community design. Sometimes, youâ€™ll find me dreaming about the multiverse of magical disciplines, authoring environments, and inter-generational neighborhoods.

For most of my days, I feel both exponentially lost and immensely motivated. However, if you know me in real life, you probably won't spot either on my face.

I enjoy sending out and receiving physical letters, so if you'd like to receive a postcard from me, email me your mailing address at wei (at) weiwei (dot) place.

<div class="collection-bodypart">
I am an American-born Taiwanese who grew up in Shanghai who speak more Cantonese than Taiwanese. I studied Interaction Design at <a href="https://www.cca.edu">California College of the Arts</a>. Occasionally, I think about going to grad school in Boston.
<br><br>
At CCA, I was very fortunate to learn from those who has been shaping the internet and the world around us. They exposed me to a world that I didn't know existed before. I will be forever grateful to the teachers and friends that I've met during my time there.
<br><br>
I care tremendously about cultivating communities, climate change, long-term research & development, and education. It is my life-long goal to put equal efforts into these four areas.

<div class="collection-bodypart">
In the Summer and Winter of 2015, I joined an accelerator and co-working space, <a href="http://www.thexnode.com">XNode</a>, as their first Design Intern and San Francisco representative in Shanghai. During my time there, I initiated and delivered weekly design digests to the team for internal growth, produced creative promotional materials, and wrote articles for their publication for external use as well. Through those commitments, I learned to facilitate the conversations that we as a team would want to have, because what people act on depends on what people converse about.

In Summer of 2017, I was an Interaction Design intern at <a href="https://www.fjordnet.com">Fjord</a>. During my time there, I focused on researching and modeling information systems for medical and government sectors.

I look for areas that don't get the attention they deserve and try my best to facilitate those conversations, together with others. In high school, I co-designed a diary book that both students and faculty still use today. At CCA, I co-created a trading group, called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1628063617472760/">The CCA Underground</a>, that has hosted 900+ trades. A few friends and I have also created an alt college mascot, called <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/behind-ccas-unofficial-mascot-da63d68f15c?gi=40244c6e1129">Max CCA</a>, some referred to it as our school's Banksy.
<br><br>
In my freshman year, I joined <a href="http://www.aiga.org/video-medalist-john-bielenberg">John Bielenberg's</a> experimental program Secret Project at CCA and expanded the program to Taiwan and produced three summer programs on challenging the status quo at <a href="https://taiwaneverything.cc/2016/08/19/toucheng-farm/">Toucheng Farm</a>in YiLan, Taiwan. After college, a few friends and I turned one of our tabletop game into a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/weiweihsu/quickstarterbbcube-a-shouting-game-for-civilized-p">Kickstarter project</a>, it was extremely fun, tiring, and chaotic.
